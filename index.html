      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>I got into Python some time ago initially when I was beginning to learn Data Science. Since then, I have taken several Python courses and I learned to do much more with it, including build some simple applications and use APIs. In my line of work I also use Python daily for purposes of quantitative research. I frequently have to write requests, compose queries to fetch data from different places, work with APIs, custom-designed packages with specific functions and so much more.  </p>

      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
      <p>Having spent multiple years in tech support, I can safely say I've seen it all ðŸ˜‚. And by that I mean exotic issues of difficult clients with varying degrees of literacy. I've supported clients of Google, I've supported the server hardware of big enterprises. Today, besides the many other tasks I have, I also assist clients of the fintech industry on their Quant research journey. </p>

      <h3>Mathematics</h3>
      <p>The love of my life will forever be Mathematics, which is what I studied in Uni. The reason I got into Data Science in the first place was because I would really love it if I could find real life application of calculus and statistics. </p>
